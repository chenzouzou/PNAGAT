# PNAGAT
PNAGAT is a graph network model for the MDA prediction task. The paper titled "PNAGMDA: A Principal Neighborhood Aggregation based
Graph Neural Network for miRNA-disease association prediction".

The dataset used in this experiment is attached to the data document. Except the llsim.csv file, which is attached to the latest Releases.

model is the proposed method. utils contains the HMDD 2.0 data. The utilsnew contains the HMDD 3.2 data, and modelHMDD32 should be compiled with it.

Run main.py to get the results.
